This is a RAG-powered Ubuntu help assistant that uses a local LLM (via Lemonade server) to answer Ubuntu questions with context from actual man pages and documentation. It streams responses quickly and assumes standard Ubuntu 
  tools are installed.

  Let me craft something punchy and descriptive.

● Ubuntu Help Assistant: Ask questions about Ubuntu and get instant, AI-powered answers grounded in real man pages and documentation - all running locally with streaming responses that feel lightning fast. 
  No more context-switching to browsers or digging through docs - just type your question and get actionable terminal commands tailored to your system. 🟠

Prototype Ubuntu Help Assistant which combines locally installed man pages and ubuntu user documentation with a model served by Lemonade, loaded with lots of local system context to help provide relevant answers. Still rough and in need of lots of polish.
